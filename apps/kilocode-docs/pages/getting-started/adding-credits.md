# Adding More Ordinant.ai Credits

Once you've used any initial free Ordinant.ai Credits, you can easily add more:

- Subscribe to the [Ordinant Pass](https://ordinant.ai/features/ordinant-pass), the most cost effective way to add credits.
- Purchase additional credits as a one-time transaction.
- Enable automatic top-up, which purchases additional credits when your balance is below $5.

These options are available to purchase from your [personal profile page](https://app.ordinant.ai/profile).

You can also use subscriptions or credits you may have purchased directly with an AI provider by adding your keys on the [Bring your own Key (BYOK)](https://app.ordinant.ai/byok) settings screen. For setup details and supported providers, see [Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)](/basic-usage/byok). If your provider is not yet supported, you can also [directly connect your provider](/getting-started/connecting-api-provider.md) in the extension and CLI.

## Transparent Pricing

At Ordinant.ai, we believe in complete pricing transparency:

- Our pricing matches the model provider's API rates exactly
- We don't take any commission or markup.
- $1 you give us becomes $1 of Ordinant.ai credits
- We debit your Ordinant.ai credits exactly what the provider charges us in dollars
- You only pay for what you use with no hidden fees

## Future Plans

We're continuously working to improve Ordinant.ai and expand our offerings:

- Additional LLM providers will be added in the future
- More payment options and other plans are under development
